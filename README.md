The project features an interactive map visualizing chronic disease spread across the United States, highlighting regions with significant disease prevalence and mortality. Designed for public health enthusiasts, government agencies, and policymakers, the tool provides state-level data and forecasts to aid in resource allocation, planning, and prevention. Success will be evaluated based on user feedback and the impact of resources on high-risk areas.
